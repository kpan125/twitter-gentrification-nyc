# Twitter & Gentrification in NYC

### About
This interactive map was created to visually explore the relation between Twitter activity and gentrification.

### Data
Aggregated Twitter data and [gentrification/displacement typologies](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/udp_methodology_for_ny_-_jan_2019.pdf) were provided by the [Urban Displacement Project](http://www.urbandisplacement.org/) at UC Berkeley, as part of my NYU-CUSP 2019 capstone project. Shapefiles from the [NYC Planning Metro Explorer](https://metroexplorer.planning.nyc.gov/about) were used to obtain the NYC geography and a spatial join via QGIS tied the two together.
